# Honey-Tablist
 
This API coded for 1.7.10 Spigot/Bukkit plugins. If you don't know how to use, i'll show you. Honey Tablist API is forked of Azazel. I just added tick & player management and fixed all bugs. I spent 2 months on this API. It is very simple to use. You will only copy the tablist sources to your source. Didn't understand? Don't worry, i'll help you again.

# Installation

Drag Honey API files to your sources.
Then put this code to your main class.

`new Honey(this, new TabProvider());` for your onEnable().

Finally, import classes and its done. You will edit tab style on **TabProvider.java**. Only 32 characters can useable. Don't try to change package names, because some classes working with path location. Your project might be buggy. That's why, listen up developer and don't try this.
