# Honey-Tablist
 
This API coded for 1.7.10 Spigot/Bukkit plugins. If you don't know how to use, i'll show you. Honey Tablist API is forked of Azazel. I just added tick & player management and fixed all bugs. I spent 2 months on this API. It is very simple to use. You will only copy the tablist sources to your source. Didn't understand? Don't worry, i'll help you again.
